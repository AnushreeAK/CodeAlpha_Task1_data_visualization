"This project focuses on Data Visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. It transforms raw data into meaningful visual insights through charts, graphs, and a correlation heatmap. The visualizations help in understanding data trends, comparisons, and relationships for better decision-making." Data Visualization - CodeAlpha Internship Task 3 Project Overview

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship. The goal of this task is to transform raw data into visual formats like charts, graphs, and dashboards using Python visualization libraries. Data visualization helps in understanding patterns, trends, and insights effectively.

Task Requirements

Convert raw data into meaningful visual representations. Use visualization libraries like: Matplotlib Seaborn (Optional) Tableau or other tools Create compelling data stories to support decision-making.

Tools & Technologies Python 3.x Pandas (for data handling) Matplotlib (for basic charts) Seaborn (for advanced visualizations)
