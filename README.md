# Data Visualization Project

This project is centered around Data Visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. It converts raw data into clear and meaningful visual insights through various charts, graphs, and a correlation heatmap.

## Project Overview

This task is part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship, focusing on transforming raw datasets into visual formats like charts, graphs, and dashboards using Python.

## Task Requirements

- Convert raw data into meaningful visual representations
- Use visualization libraries:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- Create compelling data stories to support decision-making

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for basic charts)
- Seaborn (for advanced visualizations)

## Files in this Repository

- `data_visualization_task3.py` → Main Python script for visualizations
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## Visualizations Included

- Bar Chart: Monthly Sales Overview
- Line Chart: Sales vs Profit Trend Analysis
- Pie Chart: Sales Distribution by Month
- Heatmap: Sales-Profit Correlation Analysis
